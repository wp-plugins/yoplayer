Yoplayer allows you to play videos from your yospaceCDS account in your WordPress website

== Description ==

Yoplayer is a flash video player for your website which, in addition to being
able to play video files, can also play HTTP Live Stream format video (The
format used by iPad and iPhone).

The Yoplayer plugin for WordPress allows you to quickly and easily surface your
content from yospaceCDS into your WordPress site without having to write any
Javascript or embed any objects!

Simply insert a yoplayer tag, with the miid set to the Media Item ID and fid
set to the Feed ID from your yospaceCDS account and the plugin does the rest.

For ease of use, parameters which are often the same, such as fid and skin,
may be set to site-wide defaults configured through the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Do I have to buy a license to use the player?

No, without a license you can play HLS from your yospaceCDS account or video
files from anywhere, however with a licence you will be able to play HLS content

Once you have purchased your licence you should place it in the root of your
wordpress site and all the players on your site will find it automatically.
